- test data not completed (convert commented code into viewable gui)

- for 2 player mode, instead of showing 'player 1 win' and 'player 2 win' in dialog, show the name

- change color button at end of game to show winning line

- highlight name label to show whose turn is it (ie when it's player 1 turn, player 1 name label change color, easier to keep track)

- improve on imperfect algorithm (medium), current one isnt that good
