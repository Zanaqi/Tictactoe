- test data not completed (convert commented code into viewable gui)

- for 2 player mode, instead of showing 'player 1 win' and 'player 2 win' in dialog, show the name

- change color button at end of game to show winning line

- improve on gui, not perfect yet (ALMOST THERE)

- font size issue - idk how change font for variables (ie label for player names in two player mode)
